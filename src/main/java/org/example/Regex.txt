 1> What are Regular Expression?
    A Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that constructs a search pattern. When you search for data in a text. You can use this search pattern to
    describe what you are looking for.
    E.g: ^[a-z0-9_-]{3,15}$ ^ -> start of the line , $ -> End of the Line
                |       |
                         |
                        3 to 15 characters long
            letters, numbers, underscore, hyphens
 2> What is java REGEX?
    The Java Regex is an API which is used to define a pattern for searching or manipulating Strings. It is widely used to define the constraint on Strings
    such as password and email validation
 3> Matcher Class ?
    Matcher Class is used to find the matches in a String.
    Boolean matches()       -> Tests weather the given regular expression  fully matches or not
    Boolean find()          -> Used to find the next expression that matches the pattern
    Boolean find(int start) -> Searches the next expression form the given start number
    String group()          -> Used to return the matched sequence
    int start()             -> Returns the starting index
    int end()               -> Returns the ending index
    int groupCount()        -> Returns the total number of the matched sequence
 4> Pattern Class ?
        Pattern Class is a compiled version of a regular Expression.
      Static Pattern compile
